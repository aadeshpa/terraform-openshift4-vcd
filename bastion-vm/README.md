Sample of bastion-vm module calling
```
module "bastion-vm" {
  source =  "./bastion-vm"
  routed_net = var.routed_net
  internal_bastion_ip = var.internal_bastion_ip
  bastion_template = var.bastion_template
  template_catalog = var.template_catalog
  bastion_password = var.bastion_password
  bastion_ip = var.bastion_ip
}
```
